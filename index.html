        <h2>Lessons</h2>
        <p>Not all students will be a Liszt or a Horowitz, but this is not the value of learning a musical instrument.  The Piano offers a fun, engaging outlet for individuals of every walk of life. Musicians are cited again and again as statistically more healthy, more intelligent and mentally fit, more calm, and generally enjoy a higher quality of life.  Whether you are an aspiring professional musician or an avid enthusiast and music lover, learning the piano or to compose is a rewarding pursuit which pays dividends throughout life.

To learn to compose is to give yourself the ability to express your thoughts, your feelings, and your understanding of "... the way it feels to live life today, right now," to quote Aaron Copland.

        <h4 id="beginner">Beginner</h4>
        <p>Beginning students have no formal musical training; musical training in a different instrument; from a distant time ago; or generally do not have the current skills to warrant higher enrollment.  Beginning students are guided through proficiency exercises and approaches, learning sustainable and holistic approaches to the reading, comprehension, preparation, and preparation of music.</p>

        <h4 id="intermediate">Intermediate</h4>
        <p>Intermediate students are able to approach and perform literature, and are primarily engaged in technical refinement, with considerable focus on hand posture, hand execution, strength and flexibility, finger independence, as well as more nuanced musical skills derived from dynamics, articulations, embellishments, phrasing, pedaling, and attack. Theoretical exercises seek to reinforce technical skills and abilities, and are used primarily to accelerate technical proficiencies and comprehension.</p>

        <h4 id="advanced">Advanced</h4>
        <p>Advanced students are fully competent students, technically sophisticated and musically cultured.  Studies focus primarily on the crafting of unique interpretations, nuanced understandings, and polished performances.  Theoretical exercises dig into deeper, nuanced understandings of musical composition and performance approaches, history, musicological analysis, and aural skills of an advanced aptitude.  Musical abstraction, large scale control and execution, and sophisticated technical approaches should be within reach and discernible.</p>

            <blockquote> "I've been Matthew's student for about a year and a half, and he's amazing. He knows his stuff (he plays and composes brilliantly), and does a fantastic job of figuring out how and when to tell you what you need to know to take the next step. He's never overwhelming or too slow. He'll get you to your goals, wherever you're starting from.  I had a bit of piano when I was really little, and some other musical background, but couldn't play to save my life. Matthew went my speed, kept me motivated, pushed me when I needed pushing but understood when life got in the way. He's also incredibly sweet, and loves to loop students in to his monthly piano salons. He charges reasonable rates, and instills a real love of the piano. He makes an intimidating world of music accessible. I couldn't recommend him highly enough!" -Selena Simmons-Duffin, Intermediate Student </blockquote>

            <blockquote>"Matthew is an incredibly talented piano teacher! His lessons are engaging, from start to finish, and he has a way of motivating students to understand all aspects of the instrument, including technical skill, theory, and composition. This comprehensive approach was presented in an easy-to-understand manner, at just the right pace for my schedule and ability level.   Overall, Matthew has instilled in me a love of musical learning and appreciation for the instrument. I look forward to our lessons all week and cannot recommend him highly enough." -John Karalis, Intermediate Student</blockquote>

            <blockquote>"I've been one of Matthew's students for a year. He is conservatory trained and certainly knows his way around a piano. His is also very interested in the history of the piano, the lives of composers, and tries to bring this information to each lesson.  He is also very good a accommodating students who don't have a lot of time to practice; which, as a working adult, I appreciate." -Adam Mills-Campisi, Intermediate Student</blockquote>
