            <blockquote class="blockquote-review">I am an elementary school music teacher who took piano lessons both in college and when I was young.  However, I never felt confident with my piano skills.  I started studying with Matthew about a year ago, and In that time, I've learned more and progressed faster than in all the years I took lessons when I was younger.  Though he is rigorous, and holds his students to high standards, he paces things when he knows life gets in the way of practice.  Since i have a music background myself, I really appreciate how he explains music theory. It's clear he has put a lot of thought into how he explains concepts that can be pretty complex.

            <blockquote class="blockquote-review">Incredibly talented piano teacher! His lessons are engaging, from start to finish, and he has a way of motivating students to understand all aspects of the instrument, including technical skill, theory, and composition. This comprehensive approach was presented in an easy-to-understand manner, at just the right pace for my schedule and ability level. Overall, Matthew has instilled in me a love of musical learning and appreciation for the instrument. I look forward to our lessons all week and cannot recommend him highly enough.

    I knew nothing about music before I became a student of Matthew's.  I knew I loved music, I loved to write music, I was a singer who knew how hit some keys to make some nice sounding music. I got by ok by doing that but I was tired of not knowing why or how. I decided to learn how to become a well rounded musician, a talented composer and skilled pianist. Matthew is truly invested in his students, Studio V isn't a factory and the students aren't pay checks. Matthew has the knowledge and talent to be a very successful composer and or performer but he chose to become a teacher because he loves teaching. I have been a student of Matthews for 9 months now and you would not believe how far I have come, I cannot believe it.
