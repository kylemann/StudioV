        <p class="tuition-text"><span class="who-for">Beginning students</span> have no formal musical training; musical training in a different instrument; from a distant time ago; or generally do not have the current skills to warrant higher enrollment. Beginning students are guided through proficiency exercises and approaches, learning sustainable and holistic approaches to the reading, comprehension, preparation, and preparation of music.</p>

        <p class="tuition-text"><span class="who-for">Intermediate students</span> are able to approach and perform literature, and are primarily engaged in technical refinement, with considerable focus on hand posture, hand execution, strength and flexibility, finger independence, as well as more nuanced musical skills derived from dynamics, articulations, embellishments, phrasing, pedaling, and attack. Theoretical exercises seek to reinforce technical skills and abilities, and are used primarily to accelerate technical proficiencies and comprehension.</p>

        <p class="tuition-text"><span class="who-for">Advanced students</span> are fully competent students, technically sophisticated and musically cultured.  Studies focus primarily on the crafting of unique interpretations, nuanced understandings, and polished performances.  Theoretical exercises dig into deeper, nuanced understandings of musical composition and performance approaches, history, musicological analysis, and aural skills of an advanced aptitude.  Musical abstraction, large scale control and execution, and sophisticated technical approaches should be within reach and discernible.</p>

            <h3>Statement of Policies</h3>
            <p><span class="who-for">General:</span> All students are required to commit to four months of lessons at the commencement of their studies.  Tuition is due by the 1st of the calendar month, with open billing occurring for 1- calendar days before the 1st of each month.  All payments made after the 1st of the calendar month are late, and subject to the late fee.  All students must accumulate 1 hour of theoretical instruction per calendar month and take a lesson once a week.  Lesson times are fixed in the studio calendar for as long as the student remains actively enrolled. </p>
        
       
            <p><span class="who-for">Tuition Calculation:  </span> The studio teaches 48 weeks per year.  The studio is closed for the remaining 4 weeks for holidays.  Closure will occur for 1 week at Thanksgiving, 1 week at Christmas, and 2 additional weeks to be determined annually.  Tuition is calculated by adding a practical lesson total (48 lessons/year divided by 12 months), an hour of theory, and the fixed monthly fee.  No deduction is given during holiday closure outlined above as these weeks have already been withheld in the yearly calculation.</p>
