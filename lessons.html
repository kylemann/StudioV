        <p class="first"> The Piano offers a fun, engaging outlet for individuals of every walk of life. Musicians are cited again and again as statistically more healthy, more intelligent and mentally 
fit, more calm, and generally enjoy a higher quality of life.  Whether you are an aspiring 
professional musician or an avid enthusiast and music lover, learning the piano or to compose is 
a rewarding pursuit which pays dividends throughout life.
</p>
            <blockquote>To learn to compose is to give yourself the ability to express your thoughts, your feelings, and your understanding of the way it feels to live life today, right now <br>

- Aaron Copeland

         <h3>What Style Will I Learn?</h3>
        <p>The Studio gives a Western Classical Education to its students.  Many popular, jazz, rock, hip hop, and electronic musicians have actively sought out the studio primarily to provide them with a rigorous Classical approach that can assist in giving them foundational knowledge and understandings about their musical approach and direction.  Enthusiasts and amateurs of all ages enjoy the freedom that a Classical education provides to them, giving them a sustainable, problem-solving-based approach which allows them to feel in control of their relationship with music and musical performance. </p>
<h3>Lesson Expectations</h3>
            <p>Students lessons will have three main elements: a warm up to provide the hands and mind an ability to center upon the lesson to commence, practical / technical instruction at the piano, and theoretical / musicological instruction concerning concepts or ideas relating to the material or the curriculum being covered.</p>

        <h4 id="beginner">Beginner</h4>
        <p>Beginning students have no formal musical training; musical training in a different instrument; from a distant time ago; or generally do not have the current skills to warrant higher enrollment. Beginning students are guided through proficiency exercises and approaches, learning sustainable and holistic approaches to the reading, comprehension, preparation, and preparation of music. <span class="study-type"><a href="tuition.html">(See Pricing)</a></span></p>
        
        <h4 id="intermediate">Intermediate</h4>
        <p>Intermediate students are able to approach and perform literature, and are primarily engaged in technical refinement, with considerable focus on hand posture, hand execution, strength and flexibility, finger independence, as well as more nuanced musical skills derived from dynamics, articulations, embellishments, phrasing, pedaling, and attack. Theoretical exercises seek to reinforce technical skills and abilities, and are used primarily to accelerate technical proficiencies and comprehension. <span class="study-type"><a href="tuition.html">(See Pricing)</a></span></p>
           
        <h4 id="advanced">Advanced</h4>
        <p>Advanced students are fully competent students, technically sophisticated and musically cultured.  Studies focus primarily on the crafting of unique interpretations, nuanced understandings, and polished performances.  Theoretical exercises dig into deeper, nuanced understandings of musical composition and performance approaches, history, musicological analysis, and aural skills of an advanced aptitude.  Musical abstraction, large scale control and execution, and sophisticated technical approaches should be within reach and discernible. <span class="study-type"><a href="tuition.html">(See Pricing)</a></span></p>
