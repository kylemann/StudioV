fit, more calm, and generally enjoy a higher quality of life.  Whether you are an aspiring 
professional musician or an avid enthusiast and music lover, learning the piano or to compose is 
a rewarding pursuit which pays dividends throughout life.

         <h3>What Style Will I Learn?</h3>
        <p>The Studio gives a Western Classical Education to its students.  Many popular, jazz, rock, hip hop, and electronic musicians have actively sought out the studio primarily to provide them with a rigorous Classical approach that can assist in giving them foundational knowledge and understandings about their musical approach and direction.  Enthusiasts and amateurs of all ages enjoy the freedom that a Classical education provides to them, giving them a sustainable, problem-solving-based approach which allows them to feel in control of their relationship with music and musical performance. </p>
            <p>Students lessons will have three main elements: a warm up to provide the hands and mind an ability to center upon the lesson to commence, practical / technical instruction at the piano, and theoretical / musicological instruction concerning concepts or ideas relating to the material or the curriculum being covered.</p>

            <h3>Lesson Expectations</h3>
            <p><span class="small-cap">student code:</span> I am committed to being respectful to myself and to my instructor. I am committed to my studies, my betterment, and the success of my peers to the best of my abilities. My time in the Studio is limited; I will make the most of it through my hard work, preparation, and enthusiasm.  The Studio is grounded in a love of music; I will embrace this commitment in my Studio life.</p>
        
       
            <p><span class="small-cap">general:</span> Adequate practice time is expected of each student. Assignments should be completed outside of studio time: guided practicing is not a productive use of Studio time.  In these situations, the instructor may choose to engage in an extended conceptual lesson, or the instructor may conclude the lesson early and send the student home.
            </p> 
       
            <p><span class="small-cap">grading, literature, and assignments:</span> All students are graded and monitored on an individual curriculum and will be contingent  upon reasonable understandings of the student’s circumstances and needs. The Studio will give a classical education to its students.  Foundational literature must be mastered, but seeking out music that is particularly interesting to individual taste is encouraged. Technical students will be assigned Weekly Assignments to develop sight-reading skills and hone individual musical technical skills. These works must be completed in the span of a week and graded.</p>
            
            <p><span class="small-cap">practice and physical requirements:</span> Students should commit to practice the piano every day, even if this is only for ten or fifteen  minutes. Practice strategies are fundamentally important, and will  be discussed  frequently with students  as their  curriculum  needs evolve. Students will be given various physical exercises to perform that will assist in the strengthening  and development  of  task-specific   muscles involved in the  playing of piano.  Students with demonstrated  motor-skill issues will  be refered to physical therapists to  rectify the situation.</p>
             <p><span class="small-cap">outside resources:</span> The Studio encourages students to do research outside of the instruction they receive, but it is expected that students will defer to the instructor’s  pre­ rogatives if the information conflicts with studio instruction.  This is particularly important when  discussing  misleading  or factually  incorrect  information  available  on YouTube  and Mass  Media.</p>
            <p><span class="small-cap">recitals:</span> Students will be expected to participate in the recitals offered by the Studio. These works must be performed from memory.  For exceptional students, the instructor may require a multi-movement work, several works, or sight reading.</p>
